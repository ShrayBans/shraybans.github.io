                    <p>So what is Ethereum? Ethereum is a virtual computer built on top of blockchain technology, which allows people to access a public blockchain, which anyone can add to. Blockchains are complex, but in one sentence: they are a distributed database that peers around the world can add to, but cannot alter since everyone owns a copy of the original, so the system will recognize the altered copy and reject it. If you’ve heard of blockchains before, you probably know what Bitcoin is. While the Bitcoin blockchain is mainly used for solely financial transactions, the Ethereum computer has the ability to do just a little bit more. Specifically, it allows for logic to be programmed into the blockchain to route Ethereum money, aka Ether, based on what the logic in the blockchain dictates. The capabilities of this are endless: online marketplaces, secure online poker, and even secure presidential voting.
                    The core of the logic in Ethereum is put into structures called smart contracts. They are able to store and manipulate data on the blockchain. So can’t anyone just store huge amounts of data to the Ethereum blockchain and make everyone else download it to their copy? Well, data storage on the blockchain is extremely expensive, so it is important to keep the smart contracts as short and succinct as possible.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Blockchains</h3>

                    <p>So Ethereum seems really complicated; it uses blockchain technology, something called smart contracts, and can allow you to store data publicly, but why is it actually useful? Security, serverless apps, and decentralization of data. Security is the main concern that blockchain is trying to solve because in the blockchain, all the transaction data stored on it is essentially immutable, so nobody is able to change it. Another big benefit is that your app is able to be serverless and decentralized, eliminating high traffic and computational costs that a central server and database would endure. Lastly, and most of all, the ideal that Ethereum is striving for is the decentralization of data. Big cloud providers (such as Dropbox), not only control all your information, but if they are hacked (like Dropbox has been recently), it is possible for your information to be accessed by people who you cannot even trust. Instead with decentralized blockchain technology, users can have full controls of their accounts and their data, without others having access to all of their vital account information.</p>
                                
                    <h3>Decentralized Applications</h3>

                    <p>My motivation behind this post is to inform others about the benefits of the Ethereum and what it can do specifically do for us in the future, so that more developers can start trying to contribute to the decentralized app space. I have started a venture with two colleagues where we are trying to create a platform for external file storage using Ethereum. Essentially, users would use an app to transfer files from their computer (for a small monthly fee) to other hosts (who would store these files for a fraction of that fee). Like I said before, storing files to the Ethereum blockchain is very expensive. However, I was able to incorporate another technology to provide file transfer functionality called IPFS that tightly couples with Ethereum due to its decentralized nature. You can check out our open source project at <a href="http://destore.io/">Destore.io</a> and if you would like to understand more about making decentralized applications using the Ethereum blockchain, you can visit the <a href="https://github.com/DeStore/destore">GitHub Page</a>. We included extensive documentation on how to write solidity contracts as well as how to deploy them. We also plan to come out with an npm package to abstract much of the deployment process of each contract using simple methods in a common language such as Javascript!</p>
